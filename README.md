# UHCL Indoor Navigation Vision

Computer-vision research and prototype development for the UHCL indoor-navigation senior project, with GPU-performance experiments that can also support CENG 6536 Heterogeneous Computing.

## Goals

- Explore computer-vision techniques useful for indoor navigation and visual localization.
- Prototype image and video processing with OpenCV.
- Evaluate YOLO where object or landmark detection is useful.
- Compare CPU and NVIDIA CUDA GPU execution for relevant workloads.
- Measure latency, FPS, scalability, and data-movement overhead.
- Develop components that can later integrate with the main UHCL indoor-navigation application.

## Current hardware / acceleration environment

Development and benchmarking currently target an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti (8 GB) with CUDA 12.6 under WSL2 Ubuntu.

## Planned progression

1. Validate OpenCV image and video processing.
2. Explore visual features and landmark matching for indoor localization.
3. Test YOLO inference where object/landmark detection adds value.
4. Establish repeatable CPU and GPU benchmarks.
5. Evaluate memory-transfer and end-to-end latency, not only kernel/inference time.
6. Integrate useful vision functionality into the UHCL indoor-navigation project.

## Heterogeneous Computing connection

The Senior Project uses the computer-vision functionality itself. The Heterogeneous Computing project can use the same workload to study CPU vs. GPU performance, CUDA acceleration, memory/data-movement costs, and scalability. This keeps application development and performance research connected without maintaining duplicate implementations.

## Status

Initial repository setup. OpenCV validation is the first implementation milestone.
